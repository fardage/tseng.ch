Just like in sports, you have to do regular exercises to stay fit in programming. This summer I've decided to explore Electron by building a document sorting app. Sorting PDF files can be boring and tedious. Clasificar analyzes your file structure and sorts your documents into the appropriate folders. Are your PDFs not searchable? No problem, the app runs OCR on your files.
