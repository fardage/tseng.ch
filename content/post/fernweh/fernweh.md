Instead of studying for final exams, I've been procrastinating constantly this semester. Xamarin from Microsoft got me incredibly intrigued. The ability to cover two platforms with one programming language was something I found impressive. So I decided to learn it by coding an app.

Fernweh is a packing list app and helps you to organise your packing list for your next vacation. Enter your destination, swipe right on activities you plan to do and start packing!

The focus of Fernweh was usability by applying modern UI design elements. And yes, I spend a lot of time browsing [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) to get some inspiration.
