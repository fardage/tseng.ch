In the module "Mobile Application Development 1" we learned concepts of Android app development. My college and I came up with the idea to code a multiplayer Pong for Android. We've been using Kotlin to write the code and used sockets to communicate over the network. The gyroscope detects the phone's orientation and acts as a game controller. Via QR codes players can join and host games easily and seamlessly.
