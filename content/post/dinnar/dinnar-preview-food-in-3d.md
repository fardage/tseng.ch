DinnAR is a side project that I am working on to preview food in 3D. Using Apple's Object Capture API, any object can be scanned. I was thinking that it would be cool to view restaurant dishes online in augmented reality.  I created the web application using Next js.

[DinnAR.app](https://dinnar.app/) allows you to view food from different angles and zoom in on the food. You can also discover restaurants nearby, or search for restaurants in other cities.
