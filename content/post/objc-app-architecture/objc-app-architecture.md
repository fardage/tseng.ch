"App Architecture: IOS Application Design Patterns in Swift" by objc is an excellent resource for iOS beginners like myself who want to improve their understanding of app architecture. Written by Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler, and Matt Gallagher, the book provides in-depth coverage of the key aspects of iOS app architecture, including best practices and design patterns for building robust and maintainable iOS applications. With this comprehensive guide, beginners will learn how to structure their code, design a good app architecture, use model-view-controller (MVC) and other design patterns, and ensure code quality through testing.

One of the book's strengths is its use of real-world examples and case studies to illustrate concepts and provide practical tips for building efficient and scalable iOS apps. Whether you are working on a small personal project or developing an enterprise-level application, the principles and techniques in this book will help you create applications that are well-designed and easy to maintain.

It is important to note, however, that the book was written before the introduction of SwiftUI and Combine, two of Apple's newer advances in iOS app development, and therefore focuses on using older technologies such as UIKit with storyboards. In addition, applying design patterns and best practices to an existing project can be challenging, especially when dealing with a large codebase or legacy code. Refactoring an existing project to conform to a new architecture or design pattern can be time consuming and difficult, and often requires a deep understanding of the existing code and how it is used.

Nevertheless, the concepts and tips presented in this book are still relevant and applicable in today's iOS development world, and beginners will find it an excellent resource for improving their app architecture skills.
